# Run_sspace-longread
Run_sspace-longread is an optimized edition of SSPACE-LongRead. 
We use the software mecat and minimap2 to align the raw Pacbio 
reads to the assembled contigs or scaffold insteading of blasr.
Both of them have a higher efficiency than the software blasr, 
which is nearly 10 times faster.
